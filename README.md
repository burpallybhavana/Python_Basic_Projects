# Python Basic Projects 🚀 

This Repository contains **My Daily Python Learning Projects**.
Each day I practice and upload small Python programs based on the concepts I learn.

## 📌 Daily Progress
- ✔️ Day 01: Operators (Arithmetic, Assignment, Relational, Logical)
- ✔️ Day 02: Advanced Operators (Bitwise, Membership, Identity)

## 🎯Goal
I am Documenting my journey of learning python step by step because:
> **Practice makes a programmer perfect, tracking the progress improves efficiency.**
This repo will serve as my **learning journal** and **portfolio** for interviews.

Stay tuned for daily updates! 🚀
